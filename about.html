	<p>Hello! My name is Yeojoon Moon, but I also go by Joon. I was born in South Korea, but also spent some time growing up in the Middle East in a country called Kuwait. Since then, I continued to travel around, as I then moved to the United States. Growing up in Texas through middle school, high school, and college as well. After spending that time in Texas, now I've moved to Indiana to start the next stage of my life here!</p>
	<p>I don't have many hobbies, but the few hobbies I do have, I absolutely love them. For starters, I love soccer (or football), ever since I was young and I still enjoy playing it and also watching my favorite team play as well.</p>
	<p>I also like to travel and try new things as well. The video below is from when I spent some time traveling in Turkey last year, in the city of Ankara. And I also like spending time with friends, as I travel, or just in general.</p>
